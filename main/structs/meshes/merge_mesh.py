    1. Merge single-neighbor mixed cells until all (merged) polys have 2+ neighbors.
    2. For each poly with two neighbors, assume they're the true neighbors. Try to use orientation to determine left or right.
    Also add poly as a neighbor of those neighbors.
    3. For polys with 3+ neighbors, check if potential neighbors already have two neighbors set. If so, remove as potential neighbor. Readd to queue.

    Unclear if this will run into issues, especially when the interface exits the same edge twice.
